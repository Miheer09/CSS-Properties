Margins:-

Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

margin-bottom	    Sets the bottom margin of an element

margin-left	      Sets the left margin of an element

margin-right	     Sets the right margin of an element

margin-top	       Sets the top margin of an element
